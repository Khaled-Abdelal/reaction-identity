[Reaction](http://reactioncommerce.com) is an API-first, headless commerce platform built using Node.js, React, and GraphQL. It plays nicely with npm, Docker and Kubernetes.

This project, Reaction Identity, is the user interface and server for identity management, including user registration, login, logout, and password change. It works together with [reaction-hydra](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-hydra) to enable OAuth2 flows.
